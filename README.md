# simpleCalculator
This is a tiny calculator that parses input such as "1+2*(3-4)" and computes the result. Supported operations are +, -, *, /, ^. Uncomputable inputs (ill-formed, division by zero) will result in an error message.

## goal 
This is my first encounter with Haskell, coming from Scala. The (fulfilled) objective was to create this under 10 hours, to have a reference of my progress using this language.

## running
This project requires stack, a Haskell compiling manager. Clone the repo and run "stack run" to build and run.
